# Phase 4: Redis Memorystore Setup

## Current Status: IN PROGRESS

## Overview
Setting up Redis Memorystore for GenSpark AI WhatsApp Business Automation Platform according to the implementation guide specifications for caching and session management.

## Tasks Completed
- Phase 4 documentation started

## Tasks In Progress
- Redis Memorystore instance creation
- Redis configuration for application
- Connection setup and testing
- Integration patterns preparation

## Redis Configuration Requirements
```bash
# Redis instance specifications (as per implementation guide)
Instance Name: genspark-cache
Size: 1GB
Region: us-central1
Redis Version: redis_7_0
Authentication: Enabled
Network: Default VPC
```

## Redis Usage Patterns
- Session storage and management
- WhatsApp message queue processing
- Automation rule caching
- Real-time conversation state
- Rate limiting and throttling
- Background job queue management

## Integration Architecture
- Node.js Redis client (ioredis)
- Connection pooling and retry logic
- Failover and error handling
- Performance monitoring
- Memory optimization

## Next Steps
1. Create Redis Memorystore instance
2. Configure authentication and network access
3. Set up Redis client configuration
4. Create connection utilities
5. Implement caching patterns
6. Test Redis connectivity

## Status for Next Agent
Phase 4 is IN PROGRESS. Redis Memorystore configuration is being prepared according to the implementation guide specifications. Next agent should execute Redis instance creation and configure all required caching patterns.
