# Phase 7: Security Configuration (VPC, IAM, SSL)

## Current Status: IN PROGRESS

## Overview
Implementing comprehensive security configuration for GenSpark AI WhatsApp Business Automation Platform according to the implementation guide specifications including VPC networking, IAM roles, and SSL certificates.

## Tasks Completed
- Phase 7 documentation started

## Tasks In Progress
- VPC network creation and configuration
- Custom IAM roles and policies setup
- SSL certificate provisioning
- Network security and firewall rules
- Security policy implementation

## Security Configuration Requirements
```bash
# VPC and Network Security (as per implementation guide)
VPC Name: genspark-vpc
Subnet: genspark-subnet (10.1.0.0/24)
Region: us-central1
Firewall Rules: HTTP/HTTPS allowed, internal traffic enabled

# IAM Configuration
Custom Role: GenSparkAppRole
Permissions: Cloud SQL, Secret Manager, Storage access
Service Account: Proper role bindings

# SSL Certificate
Managed Certificate: genspark-ssl
Domains: app.yourdomain.com, api.yourdomain.com
Global SSL certificate
```

## Security Architecture
- VPC isolation for network security
- Custom IAM roles with minimal permissions
- Managed SSL certificates for HTTPS
- Network firewall rules for traffic control
- Security policies and access controls
- Audit logging and monitoring integration

## Next Steps
1. Create VPC network with custom subnet
2. Configure firewall rules for security
3. Set up custom IAM roles and permissions
4. Provision managed SSL certificates
5. Configure security policies
6. Test network connectivity and security

## Status for Next Agent
Phase 7 is IN PROGRESS. Security configuration is being implemented according to the implementation guide specifications. Next agent should execute security setup scripts and configure all network and access control requirements.
