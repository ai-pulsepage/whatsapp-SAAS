# Phase 8: Monitoring and Logging Setup

## Current Status: IN PROGRESS

## Overview
Setting up comprehensive monitoring and logging infrastructure for GenSpark AI WhatsApp Business Automation Platform according to the implementation guide specifications including Cloud Logging, custom dashboards, and alerting policies.

## Tasks Completed
- Phase 8 documentation started

## Tasks In Progress
- Cloud Logging configuration and log sinks
- Custom monitoring dashboards creation
- Alerting policies setup
- Cost monitoring and budgets
- Performance monitoring integration

## Monitoring Configuration Requirements
```bash
# Cloud Logging (as per implementation guide)
Log Sink: genspark-app-logs
Destination: BigQuery dataset for analysis
Filter: Cloud Run and application logs

# Custom Dashboards
- Cloud Run CPU/Memory usage
- Cloud SQL connections and queries
- Redis cache hit/miss ratios
- Application error rates
- WhatsApp API response times
- User authentication metrics

# Alerting Policies
- CPU usage alerts
- Error rate alerts
- Database connection failures
- Cost threshold notifications
```

## Monitoring Architecture
- Centralized logging with Cloud Logging
- Custom dashboards for operational insights
- Proactive alerting for system health
- Cost monitoring and budget controls
- Performance tracking and optimization
- Application-level metrics collection

## Next Steps
1. Configure Cloud Logging sinks and filters
2. Create custom monitoring dashboards
3. Set up alerting policies and notification channels
4. Configure cost monitoring and budgets
5. Implement application-level metrics
6. Test monitoring and alerting systems

## Status for Next Agent
Phase 8 is IN PROGRESS. Monitoring and logging infrastructure is being implemented according to the implementation guide specifications. Next agent should execute monitoring setup scripts and configure all required dashboards and alerts.
