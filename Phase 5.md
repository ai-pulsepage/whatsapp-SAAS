# Phase 5: Application Structure and Dockerfiles

## Current Status: IN PROGRESS

## Overview
Creating the complete application structure for GenSpark AI WhatsApp Business Automation Platform with frontend (Next.js) and backend (Node.js/Express) services according to the implementation guide's Cloud Run specifications.

## Tasks Completed
- Phase 5 documentation started

## Tasks In Progress
- Frontend application structure (Next.js)
- Backend API structure (Node.js/Express)
- Dockerfile creation for both services
- Package.json configuration
- Application architecture implementation

## Application Architecture Requirements
```bash
# Cloud Run Services (as per implementation guide)
Frontend Service: Next.js application
- Memory: 1Gi
- CPU: 1
- Port: 3000
- Min instances: 0
- Max instances: 10

Backend API Service: Node.js/Express
- Memory: 2Gi
- CPU: 2
- Port: 8080
- Min instances: 1
- Max instances: 20
```

## Directory Structure
```

├── backend/           # Node.js/Express API server
├── shared/            # Shared utilities and types
├── scripts/           # Setup and deployment scripts
└── docker/            # Docker configurations
```

## Application Components
- WhatsApp Business API integration
- Firebase authentication integration
- Database ORM and models
- Redis caching and queuing
- AI/ML integration (Anthropic Claude)
- Real-time messaging system
- Automation engine
- Multi-tenant architecture

## Next Steps
1. Create frontend Next.js application structure
2. Create backend Express API structure
3. Implement Dockerfiles for both services
4. Configure package.json files
5. Set up shared utilities and types
6. Create application entry points
7. Integrate all previous phase components

## Status for Next Agent
Phase 5 is IN PROGRESS. Application architecture is being implemented according to the Cloud Run specifications in the implementation guide. Next agent should continue building the complete application structure with proper Docker containerization.
