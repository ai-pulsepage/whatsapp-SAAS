- Backup and archival systems

## Next Steps
1. Create Cloud Storage buckets with proper permissions
2. Configure CORS for web application access
3. Set up Secret Manager with all required secrets
4. Configure IAM permissions for service accounts
5. Create storage and secret management utilities
6. Test file operations and secret retrieval

## Status for Next Agent
Phase 6 is IN PROGRESS. Cloud Storage and Secret Manager configuration is being prepared according to the implementation guide specifications. Next agent should execute storage setup scripts and configure all required security credentials.
