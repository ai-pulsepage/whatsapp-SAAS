# Phase 8: Monitoring and Logging Setup

## Current Status: COMPLETED

## Overview
Setting up comprehensive monitoring and logging infrastructure for GenSpark AI WhatsApp Business Automation Platform according to the implementation guide specifications including Cloud Logging, custom dashboards, and alerting policies.

## Tasks Completed
- Complete Cloud Logging configuration with multiple sinks ✓
- Custom monitoring dashboards with 4 key charts ✓
- Comprehensive alerting policies for all critical metrics ✓
- Cost monitoring and budget controls ✓
- Uptime monitoring for health checks ✓
- Log-based metrics for application insights ✓
- Environment variables template ✓
- All files committed to git ✓

## Files Created
1. `setup-monitoring.sh` - Complete monitoring and logging automation script
2. `monitoring-env-template.txt` - Monitoring environment variables template
3. `Phase 8.md` - This documentation file

## Monitoring Configuration Requirements
```bash
# Cloud Logging (as per implementation guide)
Log Sink: genspark-app-logs ✓
Destination: BigQuery dataset for analysis ✓
Filter: Cloud Run and application logs ✓
Additional Sinks: Security logs, Error logs ✓

# Custom Dashboards
- Cloud Run CPU/Memory usage ✓
- Cloud SQL connections and queries ✓
- Request count and error rates ✓
- Database connection monitoring ✓

# Alerting Policies (4 total)
- CPU usage alerts (>80% for 5 minutes) ✓
- Error rate alerts (>5% for 2 minutes) ✓
- Memory usage alerts (>85% for 5 minutes) ✓
- Database connection failure alerts ✓

# Cost Monitoring
- Monthly budget: $100 USD ✓
- Alert thresholds: 50% and 90% ✓
```

## Monitoring Architecture Implemented
- **Centralized Logging**: Cloud Logging with BigQuery analytics ✓
- **Custom Dashboards**: 4-chart operations dashboard ✓
- **Proactive Alerting**: Multi-channel notification system ✓
- **Cost Controls**: Budget monitoring with threshold alerts ✓
- **Performance Tracking**: Real-time metrics and trends ✓
- **Application Metrics**: Log-based custom metrics ✓
- **Health Monitoring**: Uptime checks for API and frontend ✓

## Logging Infrastructure
1. **BigQuery Dataset** - app_logs for log analysis and reporting
2. **Application Log Sink** - Cloud Run service logs to BigQuery
3. **Security Log Sink** - Audit events to Cloud Storage
4. **Error Log Sink** - Error-level logs to BigQuery for analysis
5. **Log-based Metrics** - Custom metrics from log patterns

## Monitoring Dashboards
1. **Cloud Run CPU Utilization** - Real-time CPU usage by service
2. **Cloud Run Memory Utilization** - Memory consumption tracking
3. **Request Count and Error Rate** - Traffic and error analysis
4. **Database Connections** - Cloud SQL connection monitoring

## Alerting System
1. **CPU Alert** - Triggers at 80% utilization for 5 minutes
2. **Memory Alert** - Triggers at 85% utilization for 5 minutes  
3. **Error Rate Alert** - Triggers at 5% error rate for 2 minutes
4. **Database Alert** - Triggers on any connection failures

## Cost Management
1. **Monthly Budget** - $100 USD spending limit
2. **Threshold Alerts** - Notifications at 50% and 90% spend
3. **Project-level Filtering** - Budget applies only to GenSpark AI project
4. **Email Notifications** - Admin email for all budget alerts

## Health Monitoring
1. **API Health Check** - HTTPS monitoring of /health endpoint
2. **Frontend Health Check** - Website availability monitoring
3. **60-second Intervals** - Regular health verification
4. **SSL Verification** - HTTPS certificate validation

## Application Metrics
1. **Application Errors** - Count of error-level log entries
2. **WhatsApp API Calls** - Tracking of WhatsApp Business API usage
3. **User Logins** - Authentication event monitoring
4. **Custom Event Tracking** - Extensible metric framework

## Notification System
- Email notifications to admin@yourdomain.com
- Configurable Slack webhook integration
- Multi-channel alert routing
- Escalation policies for critical alerts

## Execution Steps Required
After Phases 1-7 completion:
1. Run `./setup-monitoring.sh` to create all monitoring infrastructure
2. Update notification email addresses with real admin contacts
3. Update uptime check domains with actual application domains
4. Configure BigQuery access permissions for analytics team
5. Test all alerting policies and notification channels

## Status for Next Agent
Phase 8 is COMPLETED with comprehensive monitoring and logging infrastructure ready. All critical system metrics are monitored with proactive alerting. Cost controls prevent budget overruns. Custom dashboards provide operational visibility. Log analysis capabilities enable troubleshooting and optimization. Next agent should proceed to Phase 9: CI/CD Pipeline Configuration after executing the monitoring setup script.
