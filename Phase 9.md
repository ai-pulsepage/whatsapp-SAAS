# Phase 9: CI/CD Pipeline Configuration

## Current Status: IN PROGRESS

## Overview
Setting up continuous integration and deployment pipeline for GenSpark AI WhatsApp Business Automation Platform according to the implementation guide specifications using Cloud Build and GitHub integration.

## Tasks Completed
- Phase 9 documentation started

## Tasks In Progress
- Cloud Build configuration and triggers
- GitHub repository integration
- Docker image build automation
- Cloud Run deployment automation
- Pipeline testing and validation

## CI/CD Configuration Requirements
```bash
# Cloud Build Pipeline (as per implementation guide)
Build Configuration: cloudbuild.yaml
GitHub Integration: Repository triggers on main branch
Docker Images: Frontend and backend containers
Cloud Run Deployment: Automated service updates

# Pipeline Steps
1. Build frontend Docker image
2. Build backend Docker image  
3. Deploy frontend to Cloud Run
4. Deploy backend to Cloud Run
5. Publish images to Container Registry
```

## Pipeline Architecture
- GitHub webhook triggers on main branch push
- Cloud Build executes multi-step pipeline
- Docker images built and pushed to registry
- Automated deployment to Cloud Run services
- Health checks and rollback capabilities
- Notification on build success/failure

## Next Steps
1. Create Cloud Build configuration file
2. Set up GitHub repository integration
3. Configure build triggers and webhooks
4. Test pipeline with sample deployment
5. Configure deployment notifications
6. Validate automated rollback procedures

## Status for Next Agent
Phase 9 is IN PROGRESS. CI/CD pipeline configuration is being implemented according to the implementation guide specifications. Next agent should execute pipeline setup and configure automated deployments for both frontend and backend services.
