- Git repository already initialized ✓
- Google Cloud CLI installed and configured ✓
- Environment variables setup created ✓
- Setup script created for automated deployment ✓
- Security configurations (.gitignore) ✓
- Credentials template created ✓
- All files committed to git ✓

## Files Created
1. `.env` - Environment variables for Google Cloud configuration
2. `setup-gcloud.sh` - Automated setup script for Google Cloud project
3. `.gitignore` - Security file to prevent credential commits
4. `credentials-template.txt` - Template for storing generated credentials
5. `Phase 1.md` - This documentation file

## Environment Variables Setup
```bash
export PROJECT_ID="genspark-ai-prod"
export REGION="us-central1"
export ZONE="us-central1-a"
export SERVICE_ACCOUNT="genspark-app-sa@${PROJECT_ID}.iam.gserviceaccount.com"
```

## Required APIs to Enable
- Core services: cloudbuild, run, sql-component, sqladmin, redis, storage-component, secretmanager, cloudresourcemanager
- Firebase services: firebase, identitytoolkit
- Monitoring: logging, monitoring, errorreporting
- AI services: aiplatform, translate

## Manual Steps Required
Due to sandbox environment limitations, the following steps require manual execution:
1. `gcloud auth login` - User authentication
2. `gcloud auth application-default login` - Application default credentials
3. `gcloud billing projects link` - Link billing account (user must provide billing account ID)
4. Run `./setup-gcloud.sh` after authentication

## Next Phase Requirements
Before proceeding to Phase 2:
1. User must complete Google Cloud authentication
2. User must provide billing account ID
3. Run the setup script to create project and enable APIs
4. Verify service account creation and key generation

## Status for Next Agent
Phase 1 is COMPLETED with all preparation files created. The Google Cloud CLI is installed and configured. The next agent should execute the setup script after user completes authentication and provides billing account ID, then proceed to Phase 2: Database Setup (Cloud SQL PostgreSQL).
